            Diabetes mellitus affects over 29 million Americans with about 8 million people who go undiagnosed.
            <br>It is a condition in which there is too much glucose (also called high blood sugar) in the blood.
            <br> Normally, an organ called the pancreas releases insulin, which picks up glucose in the bloodstream 
            <br>and takes it around your body where it is then used as energy. Diabetes occurs when the pancreas
            <br> does not produce enough insulin, or when the body does not respond to insulin (“insulin-resistant”).
            <br>Too much sugar in the blood can lead to health problems.
